# tilde
`tilde` is a repository of MaxMSP and Pd objects written by <a href="http://ramagottfried.com">rama gottfried</a> (me) -- and made available here with source code for anyone who is interested.

The objects are fairly stable and have been used in several productions -- if you find any bugs please let me know by creating an issue in the repository.
